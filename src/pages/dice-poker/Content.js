	            		It features interactive dice rolling, a UI created with Python, and high score tracking. 
	            		e game feels reminiscent of an MS-DOS game using bright 8-bit colors and a sans-serif font.

	            		The game uses a small graphics library that is perfect for creating basic shapes and 
	            		inputs and is built on Python3.  The die interface and button are built as common objects 
	            		later evoked in a compartmentalized GUI file. The poker hand and poker app functionality 
	            		are separated into unique files and are evoked by an introductory file that loads on 
	            		initialization.

	            		an external file.
