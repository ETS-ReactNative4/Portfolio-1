	            		Buzztime has many web properties that utilize an array of technologies 
	            		such as buzztime.com, buzztime.com/business, stumptrivia.com, digital.stumptrivia.com, 
	            		and my.buzztime.com. As the primary web developer for the company, I regularly maintain 
	            		these websites and build out new features when needed such as connecting to new APIs, 
	            		updating existing SOAP/REST API calls, designing/redesigning pages, and optimizing 
	            		current codebases when they become legacy. If you want to learn more about my time at 
	            		Buzztime, you can visit the parent website, buzztime.com below, or you check out my resum√© and GitHub in 
	            		the footer. Get in touch with me via the form below for specific questions.
